# LeaksPro Backend – Render.com Deployment Guide
#
# 1. Push this repo (or just the backend/ folder) to GitHub
# 2. Go to https://dashboard.render.com → New → Web Service
# 3. Connect your GitHub repo
# 4. Set these config values:
#    - Root Directory : backend
#    - Build Command  : npm install
#    - Start Command  : node server.js
#    - Environment    : Node
# 5. Add a Disk:
#    - Name       : leakspro-data
#    - Mount Path : /opt/render/project/src/uploads
#    - Size       : 10 GB  (increase as needed)
# 6. Add another Disk (or same mount) for the SQLite file:
#    - Or simply keep the data/ folder inside the repo directory;
#      Render persistent disks retain data across deploys.
# 7. Add Environment Variables (optional):
#    - PORT = 3000  (Render sets this automatically)
#
# After deploy your URLs will be:
#   API   : https://your-service.onrender.com/api
#   Admin : https://your-service.onrender.com/admin
#   Stream: https://your-service.onrender.com/api/stream/<filename>
